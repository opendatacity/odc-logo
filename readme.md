You are permitted to use the ODC Logo graphics to illustrate publications about OpenDataCity and/or works of OpenDataCity. Be nice. All other rights reserved. 

## Usage

The logo looks fabulous with

* RGB 136,0,15 (#880033)
* CMYK 0,100,63,47

For grayscale environments 75% black is desired.

You may use an outline of the logo for high resolutions if it looks great that way.

Don't skew, don't stretch, and try to give it some whitespace to breathe.
